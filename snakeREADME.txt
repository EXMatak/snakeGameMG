DESCRIPTION: 
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where you control a snake that moves around the screen and tries to eat food.
The snake grows longer each time it eats the food and the objective is to be as long as possible.

FEATURES:
Control the snake's direction using arrow keys [up, down, left, right]
Eat the red food to grow the snake and earn points
The game keeps track of your score
The snake changes color after eating each piece of food
The game is displayed on a 600x600 grid

HOW TO PLAY:
1. See 'HOW TO RUN:' section of this readme.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction
3. Eat the red food to grow and earn points
4. Walls here serve as wormholes to the middle and you don't die if you eat your own tail. Get that highscore!

Have fun and enjoy the Snake Game!

REQUIREMENTS:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Turtle graphics library, which is included in Python's standart library.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:
This game is a very simple implementation of the classic Snake Game and serves as mostly a fun and educational project.

Work in Progress - WIPs:
More optimized implementation, current one renders the tail way too many times and while the game is playable at higher scores, it gets significantly more laggy (score 70s are already very slow).
A patch will be launching soon.
